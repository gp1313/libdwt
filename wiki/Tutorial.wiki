#summary Brief tutorial to libdwt usage.

= Simple program =

Include {{{libdwt.h}}} header file and call {{{dwt_util_init}}} and {{{dwt_util_finish}}} functions that allocate and release resources of the library.

{{{
#include "libdwt.h"

int main()
{
	dwt_util_init();

	// your code here

	dwt_util_finish();

	return 0;
}
}}}

= Image allocation =

Use {{{dwt_util_alloc_image}}} function to allocate a memory for your images. The transform is computed in-place. Thus, you do not need any extra memory allocated for handling of transform.
